Reforming Capitalism
• Over time, the workers developed a
class consciousness—which is an
"understanding that members of a
class share economic interests" (179).
• They unionized and secured important
rights for workers through
collective bargaining.
• Capitalism has gotten less exploitative
due to unions.
v Safer working conditions
and compensations for workplace
injury
v Eight-hour workday &
compensation for overtime
v Weekends
v Paid vacations & sick leave
v Federal minimum wage in the U.S.
The New Deal &
the Expanding
Social Safety Net
• The economic abuses of the
robber barons crashed the stock
market and caused the Great
Depression.
• But FDR responded to this crisis
of capitalism with welfare
capitalism, expanding the social
safety net with governmental
programs for the needy and
support for Americans to own
homes.
AN UNEQUAL
ECONOMY
Part Two: The New
Gilded Age & Gig
Economy
1950s Life & Nostalgia
• The American economy was globally
strongest after World War II.
• The European empires collapsed
after the War decimated their
economies.
• Since the war was not fought on
American soil, the U.S. benefitted from
the war manufacturing infrastructure it
build up; they were able to repurpose it to
produce consumer goods.
• Not all groups benefitted from these
changes; women and people of color
were excluded from many
opportunities.
• Still, during this time it was possible
for a factory worker to make a
living wage for their family.
• It was the height of economic security.
Towards a New Gilded Age
• During the Cold War, the USSR
challenged Americans for military
supremacy.
• Decades later their economic
supremacy was being challenged by
rising Asian superpowers.
• To compete with these powers, U.S.
capitalists tried to increase profit
by reducing labor costs.
• They outsourced their manufacturing to
nations lacking stringent labor force
protections.
• This worsened poverty in the U.S.
through deindustrialization; the rate of
unemployment skyrocketed.
• A service and information
economy "centered on jobs in
which workers provide services or work with
information" (184) replaced manufacturing.
The Gig Economy & the Precariat
• The work that is left for the poor and
non-college-educated people is
sparse, pays poorly, and has a high
turnover.
• The worst and least stable version of
this is the move towards gig work
"where individuals complete one short
job at a time" (155).
• Although these jobs have the advantage of
fluidity, they are risky.
• Some sociologists have argued that in this
gig economy "a new class of workers who
live economically precarious lives" (185)
has emerged called the precariat.
• Not only are these workers exploited, but
they also live very uncertain lives.
The Shrinking Social Safety Net
• Part of what makes these lives so
precarious is that they are lived on the
backdrop of a shrinking social safety
net.
• There was a big shift in the 1980s
towards a hands-off approach to the
economy and welfare.
• Around this time, union
membership started to drop, leaving this
new precariat class with few defenders.
A GLOBAL LOOK
AT ECONOMIC
INEQUALITY
How Does Inequality Vary
Cross-Culturally?
Global Poverty
Poverty is not equally distributed
across the globe.
It tends to be worse in areas
where industrial capitalism is
still developing and/or where
there is a long history of colonial
occupation.
CASE: FASHION
• The labor reforms that unions
pushed so hard for made labor
cheaper in other nations.
• Rather than solving the exploitation,
the proletariat are outsourced to
other countries.
• In many nations, the conditions
under capital are not so different
to the exploitative conditions Marx
noticed in early modern Europe.
