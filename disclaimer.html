            <h2>1. Service Status and Affiliation</h2>
            <p><strong>IndGo Air Virtual ("VA") is a non-commercial, non-profit, fan-run virtual organization developed for flight simulation enthusiasts.</strong></p>
            <p>We are not affiliated with, sponsored, endorsed by, or in any way officially connected with the real-world InterGlobe Aviation Limited (IndiGo) or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates. The official IndiGo website can be found at <a href="https://www.goindigo.in" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">goindigo.in</a>.</p>
            
            <h2>2. Trademarks, Logos, and Copyrighted Material</h2>
            <p>This Service displays and references trademarks, service marks, logos, brand names, and liveries (collectively, "Marks") belonging to third parties. These Marks may include, but are not limited to, those of airlines (e.g., IndiGo), aircraft manufacturers (e.g., Airbus, Boeing), flight planning services (e.g., SimBrief), and airport authorities.</p>
            <p>All Marks are the property of their respective owners. IndGo Air Virtual makes no claim of ownership over these materials. The use of these Marks does not imply any affiliation with, endorsement by, or sponsorship from the respective Mark holders.</p>

            <h2>3. Basis of Use (Nominative and Transformative Fair Use)</h2>
            <p>This Service is operated purely for recreational, non-commercial, and entertainment purposes within the flight simulation community. All third-party materials are used under the principles of "Fair Use" (or equivalent laws in other jurisdictions).</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Nominative Fair Use:</strong> All third-party Marks are used strictly for the purpose of identification. For example, the IndiGo logo and livery are used to identify a specific airline and aircraft within the context of a flight simulation, which is a permissible "nominative fair use."</li>
                <li><strong>Transformative Use:</strong> The use of these Marks is transformative, as they are not used for their original commercial purpose (i.e., to sell flights or aircraft) but are instead incorporated into a new, non-commercial, recreational experience for simulation enthusiasts.</li>
                <li><strong>No Confusion:</strong> This use is not intended to cause, and is not likely to cause, confusion among consumers as to the source, sponsorship, or affiliation of IndGo Air Virtual. We are a separate, fan-run entity, as stated in Section 1.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>4. No Profit or Commercial Gain</h2>
            <p>This Service is not used for any commercial purpose or financial gain. No profit is sought or generated from the use of any third-party trademarks or copyrighted materials. All activities are purely for hobbyist and entertainment purposes.</p>

            <h2>5. No Warranty</h2>

IndGo Air Virtual makes no representations or warranties in relation to this website or the information and materials provided.
