OpenWeatherMap provides many kinds of weather maps including Precipitation, Clouds, Pressure, Temperature, Wind. You can connect them to mobile and web apps.

We have launched Weather maps 2.0!

Now available Forecast, Historical and Current weather maps. 14 weather map layers with 1-hour step. You can get all of them using only one simple URL!

Google Maps JavaScript API based on OpenWeatherMap API
Google has closed their Weather and Cloud solutions since 4th of June 2015 and recommended to use OpenWeatherMap with the Google Maps JavaScript API as an alternative solution.

Libraries to connect weather layers
Open Layers

The following functions are available for the OpenLayers library:
Classes of weather layer and weather stations layer
Possibility to set your own style
Classes with clustered markers
Support of marker server clustering
Leaflet

The OpenWeatherMap javascript library is designed to work with the Leaflet mapping service. The current version of the library allows the following:
Embedding of layer with current weather in cities
Embedding of layer with weather stations
The library supports customer clustering
Leaflet library

Another implementation of map based on Leaflet technology supports OWM's TileLayers and current city/station data. It is configurable with many options. For current city/station data the library supports refreshing the data in intervals, some types of client-side clustering (show only the station/city with the highest rank for a defined pixel square), custom image set (if you provide one), different languages ("en", "de", "ru", "fr", but translation is incomplete), minZoom and others.
