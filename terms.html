            <h2>1. Agreement to Terms</h2>
            <p>Welcome to IndGo Air Virtual ("VA", "we", "us").

By creating an account and participating in our VA, you confirm that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree with all of these Terms, you are expressly prohibited from using the Service and must discontinue use immediately.</p>
            <p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> IndGo Air Virtual is a non-commercial, fan-run virtual airline for flight simulation enthusiasts. We are not affiliated with, sponsored, or endorsed by the real-world InterGlobe Aviation Limited (IndiGo).</p>

            <h2>3. User Accounts</h2>
            <p><strong>Account Integrity:</strong> When you create an account, you agree to provide information that is accurate, complete, and current. You are responsible for all activities that occur under your account. Your account is for your personal use only and may not be shared, transferred, sold, or used by any other person.</p>
            <p><strong>Security:</strong> You are responsible for safeguarding the password you use to access the Service. You agree not to disclose your password to any third party and to notify us immediately upon becoming aware of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your account.</p>

            <h2>4. Code of Conduct</h2>
            <p>All members are expected to maintain a high standard of professionalism, maturity, and respect towards all members and staff across all platforms, including our website, Discord server, and during in-flight operations. You agree not to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Engage in any form of harassment, discrimination, bullying, hate speech, or personal attacks.</li>
                <li>Share inappropriate, offensive, pornographic (NSFW), or illegal content.</li>
                <li>Spam, advertise, or post unsolicited links on any of our platforms.</li>
                <li>Impersonate staff members, other pilots, or real-world aviation personnel.</li>
                <li>Publicly dispute staff decisions or disciplinary actions. All grievances must be addressed privately with a staff member.</li>
                <li>Disrupt VA events, group flights, or any official VA operations.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>5. Prohibited Conduct and Fair Play</h2>
            <p>The integrity of our simulation experience is paramount. The following actions are strictly prohibited and will result in immediate disciplinary action, up to and including permanent termination of your account:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Data Falsification:</strong> Intentionally submitting false, manipulated, or fraudulent PIREPs (Pilot Reports). This includes, but is not limited to, editing flight logs, using another pilot's flight data, or misrepresenting flight times and routes.</li>
                <li><strong>Exploitation:</strong> Abusing bugs, loopholes, or flaws in the crew center software, ACARS, or operational rules to gain an unfair advantage in flight hours or rank progression.</li>
                <li><strong>Unrealistic Operations:</strong> Intentionally operating aircraft in a manner that grossly violates simulation realism (e.g., excessive speeding, unrealistic fuel loads, ignoring ATC instructions during events) to expedite flight completion.</li>
                <li><strong>Automation and Cheating:</strong> Using bots, scripts, or any third-party software to automate flight activities or PIREP filing for the purpose of accumulating hours without actively flying.</li>
            </ul>
             <p>All PIREPs are subject to validation by our staff. The decision of the PIREP Manager or a designated staff member to accept, reject, or amend a flight report is final.</p>

            <h2>6. Virtual Airline Operations</h2>
            <p>Your participation is governed by the operational rules and procedures of the VA:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>PIREPs (Pilot Reports):</strong> All flights must be reported accurately. For manual PIREPs, you are required to submit a valid verification image (e.g., flight summary screenshot). Flights tracked via our official ACARS system may not require a manual image but are still subject to staff review.</li>
                <li><strong>Rank Progression:</strong> Pilots advance through ranks by accumulating flight hours from approved PIREPs. Certain senior ranks require the successful completion of written and practical tests, during which time your account may be placed in a "Pending Test" status with limited operational capabilities.</li>
                <li><strong>Flight & Duty Time Limitations (FTPL):</strong> The VA enforces FTPL to simulate realistic crew operations. Exemptions are granted at the sole discretion of the staff and are considered a privilege that can be revoked at any time.</li>
                <li><strong>Callsigns:</strong> You must use your assigned VA callsign during all official VA flights and events. Callsigns are assigned by staff and are subject to change for administrative purposes.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>7. User Content</h2>
            <p>You may submit content, including profile information, biographies, profile pictures, and verification images for PIREPs ("User Content"). You retain ownership of your User Content, but by submitting it, you grant IndGo Air Virtual a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use, reproduce, display, and distribute your User Content in connection with the operation of the VA (e.g., on our staff page, public roster, leaderboards, or for PIREP verification). You warrant that you have the right to submit this content and that it does not violate these Terms.</p>

            <h2>8. Termination</h2>
            <p>We may terminate or suspend your account immediately, without prior notice or liability, for any reason whatsoever, including without limitation if you breach the Terms. Breaches leading to termination include, but are not limited to, any activity listed under "Prohibited Conduct," severe violations of the "Code of Conduct," or prolonged account inactivity as defined by internal policy.</p>
            <p>Upon termination, your right to use the Service will immediately cease, and all associated data, including flight hours and rank, will be forfeited. If you wish to terminate your account, you may do so by contacting a staff member.</p>

            <h2>9. Changes to Terms</h2>
            <p>We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time. We will provide notice of any material changes by posting the new Terms on this site and/or through a platform announcement. Your continued use of the Service after any such changes constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms.</p>

            <h2>10. Contact Us</h2>
            <p>If you have any questions about these Terms, please contact a member of the VA Staff Team through our official Discord server.</p>
