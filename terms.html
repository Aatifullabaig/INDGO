            <p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> IndGo Air Virtual is a non-commercial, fan-run virtual airline for flight simulation enthusiasts. We are not affiliated with, sponsored, or endorsed by the real-world InterGlobe Aviation Limited (IndiGo).</p>

            <h2>2. Eligibility</h2>

            <h2>3. User Accounts</h2>
            <p>When you create an account, you agree to provide information that is accurate, complete, and current. You are responsible for safeguarding the password that you use to access the service and for any activities or actions under your password. You agree not to disclose your password to any third party. You must notify us immediately upon becoming aware of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your account.</p>

            <h2>4. Code of Conduct</h2>
            <p>All members are expected to maintain a high standard of professionalism and respect towards fellow pilots and staff. You agree not to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Engage in any form of harassment, discrimination, or hate speech.</li>
                <li>Share inappropriate, offensive, or NSFW content on any of our platforms.</li>

            </ul>

            <h2>5. Virtual Airline Operations</h2>
            <p>Your participation is governed by the operational rules of the VA:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>PIREPs (Pilot Reports):</strong> All flight reports must be filed accurately. You are required to submit a verification image (e.g., flight summary screenshot) with every flight completion. Falsifying flight logs or submitting fraudulent PIREPs is strictly prohibited and will result in disciplinary action or suspension.</li>
                <li><strong>Rank Progression:</strong> Pilots advance through ranks by accumulating flight hours from approved PIREPs. Certain senior ranks require the successful completion of written and practical tests, during which time your account may be in a "Pending Test" status with limited operational capabilities.</li>
                <li><strong>Flight & Duty Time Limitations (FTPL):</strong> The VA enforces FTPL to simulate realistic crew operations, including maximum daily flight hours and minimum rest periods. Staff reserves the right to grant exemptions on a case-by-case basis.</li>
                <li><strong>Callsigns:</strong> You must use your assigned VA callsign during all official VA flights and events.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>6. User Content</h2>
            <p>You may submit content, including profile information, biographies, and verification images for PIREPs ("User Content"). You retain ownership of your User Content, but by submitting it, you grant IndGo Air Virtual a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use, display, and distribute your User Content in connection with the operation of the VA (e.g., on our staff page, leaderboards, or for PIREP verification).</p>

            <h2>7. Termination</h2>
            <p>We may terminate or suspend your account immediately, without prior notice, for any reason whatsoever, including without limitation if you breach the Terms. Upon termination, your right to use the service will cease. If you wish to terminate your account, you may do so by contacting a staff member.</p>

            <h2>8. Changes to Terms</h2>
            <p>We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time. We will provide notice of any changes by posting the new Terms on this site. Your continued use of the service after any such changes constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms.</p>

            <h2>9. Contact Us</h2>
            <p>If you have any questions about these Terms, please contact a member of the VA Staff Team through our official Discord server.</p>
